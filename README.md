## Project Description
This project is a Node.js application that serves as an API backend for handling various functionalities like adding, updating, and deleting books.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes `npm` or `yarn`)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (or use a cloud service like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas))
- A GitHub account if you plan to clone the repository or contribute to the project.

---

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/iluckyvirani/synkrama-Node-Task.git)
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. **Install dependencies** using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This will install all the necessary dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

---

## Running the Project

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the application:

1. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will run the Node.js server, and you can access the API at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port you've specified in your app).


## Environment Variables

The project uses environment variables to manage sensitive information such as database credentials. 

1. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and define the following variables:

   ```
   MONGOOSE_URI=your-mongo-db-uri
   PORT=3000
   JWT_SECRET=lucky
   ```

   Replace `your-mongo-db-uri` with the URI to your MongoDB instance (e.g., from MongoDB Atlas or your local instance).

2. If you're deploying to a platform like Vercel, you can define these environment variables in the **Environment Variables** section of your deployment settings.

---

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can use the API endpoints to interact with the backend.

- **GET** `/api/books`: Get all books
- **POST** `/api/books/add`: Add a new book
- **PUT** `/api/books/update/:id`: Update a book by ID
- **DELETE** `/api/books/delete/:id`: Delete a book by ID

Refer to the API documentation for more details on how to interact with the endpoints.

---

## Deployment

If you're deploying this project to Vercel (or another cloud service), the following steps are required:

1. Push your code to a GitHub (or GitLab) repository.
2. Connect the repository to Vercel and configure the deployment process.

Once deployed, your backend will be available at a URL provided by Vercel.
